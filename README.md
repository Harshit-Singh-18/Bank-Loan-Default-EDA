# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

## Description

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify strong indicators of default values within the dataset. Key tasks included imputing missing values, handling outliers, and binning numerical columns into categorical datasets. Univariate and bivariate analyses were executed by bifurcating the dataset based on the target value to assess correlation. Additionally, the dataset was merged with the previous year’s data to gain further insights, visualized through merged pointplots and clustered barplots.

## Features

- **Data Imputation:** Addressed missing values to ensure dataset completeness.
- **Outlier Handling:** Managed outliers to enhance data quality.
- **Feature Binning:** Converted numerical columns into categorical datasets for improved analysis.
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis:** Conducted analysis by splitting the dataset based on the target value to explore correlations.
- **Data Merging & Visualization:** Merged with the previous year’s data and visualized insights using merged pointplots and clustered barplots.
